abstract = {This paper investigates how education and export diversification contribute to energy demand by also incorporating the role of natural resource, oil prices and income in driving energy demand function for the United States (U.S.) economy. In doing so, we apply the unit root test of Kim and Perron (2009) and the bootstrapping autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration approach developed by McNown et al. (2018), which accommodates the presence of a single unknown structural break in the series. The empirical results confirm that the variables are cointegrated in a long-run relationship. Education is negatively linked to energy demand, and export diversification also decreases this demand in the long-run. On the other hand, economic growth increases energy consumption, while oil prices reduce energy demand in the long-run. Natural resource production affects energy consumption positively. Further, the Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM)'s Granger causality analysis reveals a feedback effect between education and energy demand. Export diversification causes energy demand, and in return, energy demand causes export diversification. A bidirectional causality also exists between economic growth and energy demand. The paper also discusses the potential implications of the results.},

The impulse-response functions indicate that global oil prices shock positively affects inflation in South Asian countries and this impact is permanent. The variance decomposition analysis postulates that global oil price shock does not describe any significant changes in inflation rates in short run, but this variation increases in the long run. Non-linear analysis reveals that the effect of global oil price on inflation is asymmetric. The positive oil price shock increases inflation significantly, while the influence of negative oil price shock is not significant.},

abstract = {This study examines the linkages between energy price and food prices over the period 2000–2016 by using a Panel-VAR model in the case of eight Asian economies. Our results confirm that energy price (oil price) has a significant impact on food prices. According to the results of impulse response functions, agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. Our results show that there is a linkage between energy and food security through price volatility. Since inflation in oil price is harmful for food security, it would be necessary to diversify the energy consumption in this sector, from too much reliance on fossil fuels to an optimal combination of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources that will be in favor of not only the energy security by also the food security. In addition, the paper found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2{\%} of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies.},

The empirical results of the causal link present asymmetrical features, such that when the oil markets experience supply shocks, there is a positive influence on the EPU in China, India and Brazil. Moreover, a declining COP has an impact on the EPU in Russia and South Africa. Our findings are consistent with the real business cycle model of the oil price shocks, under the influence of the channels that determine the supply and demand. The BRICS EPU also has an impact on the oil market, but their degree of significance varies, and is related to the demand for oil. Understanding the relationship between EPU and oil markets in BRICS countries can assist policymakers to rebalance of the energy landscape, and also aid in the stabilization of national economies.},

To test this perception, we use the case of India to establish in a standard SVAR model that global food prices influence aggregate prices and food prices in India. To further analyze these empirical results, we specify a small open economy New-Keynesian model including oil and food prices and estimate it using observed data over the period 1996Q2 to 2013Q2 by applying Bayesian estimation techniques. The results suggest that a big part of the variation in inflation in India is due to cost-push shocks and, mainly during the years 2008 and 2010, also to global food price shocks, after having controlled for exogenous rainfall shocks. We conclude that the inflationary supply shocks (cost-push, oil price, domestic food price and global food price shocks) are important contributors to inflation in India. Since the monetary authority responds to these supply shocks with a higher interest rate which tends to slow growth, this raises concerns about how such output losses can be prevented by reducing exposure to commodity price shocks.},

The period of the study is 1990m1 to 2017m5. The wavelet coherency results reveal that there are important and significant relations between the fuel and food prices, the fuel and industrial prices, and the fuel and metal prices. These results also show that there are phase relationships between those paired prices. The volatility spillover results indicate that the agricultural sector is the most affected by shocks from the other markets. The return series of the industrial input prices at all frequencies appears to be the main source of volatility transmission to the prices of the other commodities over the whole period. This finding underlines the relevance of the industrial inputs to policy makers, particularly when they design policies to provide incentives related to industrial production.},

They include pulses, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, spices, tea, coffee and sugar. Cost escalation was the primary reason for rising prices of milk and eggs. The high inflation of rice was caused by a complex interplay of factors. With the exception of milk, the paper finds no concrete evidence to support the popular view that the higher food prices in recent years was the outcome of a "secular shift" in food consumption patterns towards high-value agriculture products. Developments in the global economy have influenced the domestic food prices mainly through passing on world oil price increases. High cost food imports played only a very limited role.},

Oil serves as a key input to the production process, therefore, changes in its price would have a great influence on the level of inflation which at last may hamper the process of economic progress. For policy implication, the monetary authorities shall pay more attention to the increase in oil price than the oil price decrease in designing appropriate policies of price stability as the former exerts greater impact on inflation than the latter.

The results show that the world oil price affects the economic growth and inflation of China significantly, and the impact is non-linear. On the other hand, China's economic activity fails to affect the world oil price, which means that the world oil price is still exogenous with respect to China's macro-economy in time series sense, and China has not yet had an oil pricing power in the world oil markets. The structural stability tests demonstrate that there is a structural break in the VAR model because of the reforms of China's oil pricing mechanism, thus it is more appropriate to break the whole sample into different sub-samples for the estimation of the model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The debate on the dynamic behavior between oil price and domestic inflation is an ongoing process and recent literature indicated that the relationship shows non-linearities, which could have some implication for monetary policymaking. We estimate NARDL models of the link between oil price and inflation decomposed into consumer price index sub-indices of food, core, other energy and transport and find support for long-run asymmetry in relation to oil price shocks as well as incomplete pass-through of oil price to inflation. Our results suggest that it takes within 4-8 quarters for the disaggregated inflation to converge to its long-run equilibrium after a negative or positive unitary oil price shock. Hence, we conclude that there is the need to boost domestic oil refining capacity and fostering of competition in the domestic market as well as unlocking investment in other bio-fuels and other low-cost energy products to reduce energy imports in Nigeria.},

Furthermore, the findings from variance decomposition reveal that shares of oil prices in agricultural food price volatilities are the largest.

Since inflation in oil price is harmful for food security, particularly in vulnerable economies, it would be necessary to diversify the energy consumption in this sector, from too much reliance on fossil fuels to an optimal combination of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources. In addition, the paper found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2{\%} of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, especially in advanced countries, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of oil price shocks on key macroeconomic variables (i.e., real GDP, interest rate, inflation and exchange rate) for five SAARC countries (i.e., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan). For this purpose, we adopt contemporary macroeconomic policy modeling tool called impulse response function (IRF) and forecast error variance decomposition method (FEVDM) in the structural vector autorepression (SVAR) setting using time series data over the extended period from 1982 to 2014. In addition, Johansen (1991) cointegration method is applied for long-run relationship. The results of cointegration test confirms the long-run equilibrium relationship between all the underlying variables. However, the empirical findings of IRF explained significant variation among all underlying macroeconomic variables in response to exogenous oil price shocks at different time horizons. It means the macroeconomic factors are sensitive to even small oil price shocks and possess various socio-economic implications in the region. The results of FEVDM evidence that each country in a study group responds differently to oil price shocks, it corresponds their independent policies, macroeconomic fundamentals, sector constructions and heterogeneity across the countries. The findings help governments to reform public policies in the region by controlling macroeconomic fluctuations due to oil price shocks.},

Specifically, it implements various tools of methodology: the continuous wavelet power spectrum, the cross-wavelet power spectrum, the wavelet coherency, the multiple and the partial wavelet coherence to the annual sample period 1969–2014. Our results unveil that the relationships among the variables evolve through time and frequency. From the time-domain view, we show strong but non-homogenous linkages between the four variables. From the frequency-domain view, we uncover significant wavelet coherences and strong lead-lag relationships. From an economic view, the wavelet analysis shows that Saudi economy is still exposed to several global risk factors, which are mainly related to the oil market volatility, and the pegging of the local currency to the US dollar. Such risk factors strongly and negatively affect the real economic growth, exert more pressure on inflation, and substantially limit the freedom to pursue an independent monetary policy.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the nonlinear dynamics in the effects of oil price shocks on the exchange rate for a sample from the Group of Twenty (G20) over the period 1994:1-2019:1. Design/methodology/approach: Using monthly time series data covering the period1994:1-2019:1, the author first use the non-parametric triples test of Randles et al. (1980) to ascertain the existence of asymmetric properties in the sample of exchange rates. Then the author used the nonlinear ARDL cointegration approach developed by Shin et al. (2014) to examine the reaction of these exchange rates to the oil price shocks. Findings: This study has identified significant evidence that the exchange rate is asymmetrically distributed, with the effect that high appreciation of the exchange rate is followed by slower depreciation. The NARDL results support such asymmetry even more strongly because in the test the exchange rate is shown to react differently in the long term to positive and negative shocks in oil prices. Another major finding was that the speed of adjustment differed over the sample, as the cumulative dynamic multipliers effect highlighted. Research limitations/implications: This change in direction and the employment of non-linear technique can be to obtain better insight into the model specification, which the author believes, will not only enhance the findings in the literature but also enhance forecasting and decision-making. Practical implications: A practical implication of this change is the possibility that policymakers and participants concerned with exchange rate stability should intervene in the market to alleviate the unfavourable impact of oil price shocks on the exchange rate. Originality/value: Addressing this nonlinear dynamic in the effects of oil price shocks on the exchange rate have at least the following two important reasons: asymmetry and regime change are types of nonlinearities that affect the market dynamics, especially, over marked sample period with such financial crises as the global financial crises of 2007, thereby violating the linear models. Adopting an asymmetric cointegration technique permits to incorporate cointegrated positive and negative components of the considered series.},

abstract = {It is frequently argued that biofuel (and ethanol) promotion policies in the United States have created a link between oil and corn prices that has accentuated the recent rally in the price of that crop and its substitutes (especially soybeans). Even though it is intuitively appealing, one problem with this hypothesis is that ethanol policies have been in place in the US for more than 35 years, whereas the run up in food prices dates back only to 2006. However, a significant change in US biofuel policy during that year provides an adequate framework to test for the existence of a structural break in the stochastic properties of the corn and soybean price processes. The results show that structural stability is rejected, and the transmission of oil price innovations to corn prices has become stronger after 2006 (no changes with respect to soybeans). There is also a significant transmission of corn price innovations to oil and soybean prices. Moreover, the data show evidence of a previously non-existent cointegration relationship between oil and corn prices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Further, it reveals that from the total sample, no matter whether the oil price rises or falls, or the oil price is higher or lower, there is no asymmetry. However, after grouping companies according to the average investment opportunity, we found that for companies with better investment opportunities, the effect of oil price uncertainty on investment is asymmetric, since the coefficient of the interaction term between high oil prices and oil price uncertainty is significant positive. It also shows that increasing oil price uncertainty will reduce the investment efficiency of companies with poor investment opportunities, and the results of regression using inefficient investment as the explanatory variable also confirm this.

The empirical results show that the change in each grain price is significantly influenced by the changes in the crude oil price and other grain prices during the period extending from the 3rd week in 2005 to the 20th week in 2008 which implies that grain commodities are competing with the derived demand for bio-fuels by using soybean or corn to produce ethanol or bio-diesel during the period of higher crude oil prices in these recent years.

Linear methods are applied first to examine the stationarity, co-integration and linear Granger causality of the variables of crude oil and food price indices. Moreover, a series of nonlinear tests are used to detect the nonlinearity of the univariate and oil-food prices link. Finally, the asymmetric adjustment analyses are made to understand the dynamic vary mechanism depending on the considered regime of the threshold vector autoregressive model (TVAR), and the threshold vector error correction model (TVECM) is integrated to check how the variables respond to the deviations from the equilibrium. The findings of systematic tests and analyses confirm the fact that there is a nonlinear causal relationship between global crude oil and food price indices. The co-movement of crude oil and food price has obvious structural break features, which is relevant to the underlying regime. Furthermore, the results also show that the adjustment process of the food price indices towards equilibrium is highly persistent and grows faster than oil price when a threshold is reached.},

The data consists of 783 weekly observations extending from January 1994 to December 2008.

Our measure of oil price uncertainty is the conditional variance of the oil price-change forecast error. We isolate the effects of volatility in the change in the price of oil and its asymmetry on output growth and employ simulation methods to calculate generalized impulse response functions and volatility impulse response functions to trace the effects of independent shocks on the conditional means and the conditional variances, respectively, of the variables.

The first two tools are used to identify the time-frequency co-movement of and lead–lag relationship between price indices of oil and 21 agricultural commodities, and the third and fourth tools are used to identify the leader and follower among all series of price indices across different scales. Our results on wavelet coherency show a high degree of co-movement at a long-run horizon for the entire period between the price indices of oil and coal, cotton, fishmeal, maize, rice, rubber and wheat. Furthermore, the connection between these commodity markets and the oil market strengthened after 2000, indicating the importance of financial crisis phenomena and geopolitical turbulence. Additional findings show that short-run investors should invest in the beef and swine (pork) markets, as they have very little correlation with the oil markets.

abstract = {The macroeconomic outcomes of oil price fluctuations have been at the forefront of the debate among economists, financial analysts and policymakers over the last decades. Among others, the oil price-food price nexus has particularly received a great deal of attention. While an abundant body of literature has focused on the linear relationship between oil price and food price, little is known regarding the nonlinear interactions between them. The aim of this paper is to conduct aggregated and disaggregated analyses of the impact of the Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices on international food prices between January 1990 and October 2017. The empirical investigation is based on the estimation of linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. The findings confirm the presence of asymmetries since the overall food price is only affected by positive shocks on oil price in the long-run. While the dairy price index reacts to both positive and negative changes of oil price, the impact of oil price increases is found to be greater. Finally, the asymmetry is present for some other agricultural commodity prices in the short-run, since they respond only to oil price decreases. All in all, the study concludes that studies assuming the presence of a symmetric impact of oil price on food price might be flawed. The findings are important for the undertaking of future studies and the design of international and national policies in the fight against food insecurity.},

Three different kinds of oil price data were applied in this study: the actual spot oil price of individual countries, the OPEC reference basket oil price, and an average of the Brent, WTI, and Dubai oil price. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) dynamic panels were used to estimate the short- and long-term impacts. Also, we partitioned the oil price into positive and negative changes to capture asymmetric impacts and found that both the positive and negative oil price changes positively influenced inflation. However, the impact was found to be more significant when the oil prices dropped. We also found that the money supply, the exchange rate, and the gross domestic product (GDP) are positively related to inflation, while food production is negatively related to inflation. Accordingly, policy-makers should be cautious when formulating policies between the positive and negative changes in oil prices, as it was shown that inflation increased when the oil price dropped. Additionally, the use of a contractionary monetary policy would help to reduce the inflation rate. Lastly, we suggest that the government should encourage domestic food production, both in quantity and quality, to reduce inflation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the co-movement of food prices and the macroeconomic index, especially the oil price, by principal component analysis to further understand the influence of the macroeconomic index on food prices. We examined the food prices of seven major products: eggs, meat, milk, oilseeds, rice, sugar and wheat. The macroeconomic variables studied were crude oil prices, consumer price indexes, food production indexes and GDP around the world between 1961 and 2005. We use the Scree test and the proportion of variance method for determining the optimal number of common factors. The correlation coefficient between the extracted principal component and the macroeconomic index varies between 0.87 for the world GDP and 0.36 for the consumer price index. We find the food production index has the greatest influence on the macroeconomic index and that the oil price index has an influence on the food production index. Consequently, crude oil prices have an indirect effect on food prices. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this article, we analyze the changes in food trade balances associated with the 32{\%} increase in food prices from 2000/2001 to 2004/2005. We find a small deterioration in food trade balances of low-income countries and an improvement in middle-income countries. The deterioration is most severe for countries in conflict and small island states, so attention should be placed first on these countries and on a few very-low-income countries that are also vulnerable. Because low-income countries as a group had much lower agricultural GDP growth rates than middle-income countries, the answers to food vulnerability in low-income countries should probably be addressed within the context of incentives for agricultural production. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

In light of developing Asia's dependence on imported oil and food, we can expect higher global food and oil prices to result in higher domestic consumer prices in the region. However, the actual impact of the global commodity shocks on consumer price inflation in developing Asia depends on a number of other factors, including government policy measures. The objective of this paper is to examine empirically the extent of the pass-through of global food and oil prices to domestic consumer prices in nine countries in the region. The main empirical result is that the magnitude of the pass-through has been limited. Government policy measures, for example, subsidies and price controls, played a role in reducing or delaying the pass-through of oil and food price increases to domestic prices. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

For this purpose, the long and short-run impact of per capita income, FDI, and oil price on carbon emissions investigated by employing the ARDL and non-linear ARDL cointegration methodology, along with Granger causality in the context of Pakistan for 1971–2014. This study confirms the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan under both methodologies, whereas symmetric results show that economic growth and FDI intensify carbon emission in both the long and short-run, while oil price increase emission in the short-run and reduces emission in the long-run. Whereas asymmetric results in the long-run show that an increase in oil price reduces emissions and decrease in oil price intensify emissions. The causality analysis also supports the above findings and suggests a feedback effect between economic growth and carbon emission in Pakistan. This study provides implications for policymakers, where the descending flow of FDI allows limited space to Pakistan in FDI selection; however, the presence of emission convergence and adoption of carbon pricing may facilitate Pakistan in achieving its environmental targets. While diversifying the overall energy mix towards more renewable/clean energy along with formulating favorable policies for the adoption of renewable energy like solar by the industrial and residential consumers can further reduce the overall emission levels.},

We apply a Granger-causality in quantiles analysis that evaluates causal relations in each quantile of the distribution. Under this approach, we can discriminate between causality affecting the median and the tails of the conditional distribution. We find evidence of bi-directional causality between changes in renewable energy consumption and economic growth at the lowest tail of the distribution; besides, changes in renewable energy consumption lead economic growth at the highest tail of the distribution. Our results also support unidirectional causality from fluctuations in oil prices to economic growth at the extreme quantiles of the distribution. Finally, we find evidence of lower-tail dependence from changes in oil prices to changes in renewable energy consumption.

An empirical analysis is carried out by employing structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) framework. Generalised Impulse Response Functions and Generalised Forecast Variance Decompositions are employed to track the impact of oil and food price shocks to Pakistan's economy. Results suggest that oil price shock affects industrial production, appreciates real effective exchange rate negatively and affect inflation and interest rate positively. Whereas, following food price shocks, industrial output increases. Similarly, interest rate and inflation rate responds positively following food price shocks. However, the variation in interest rate due to food price shock is relatively larger than that of oil price shocks. Generalised impulse response functions reveal that real effective exchange rate is most important source of disturbances following either oil price or food price shocks. Generalised forecast variance decompositions analysis also supports the findings based on generalised impulse response functions. The result clearly reveals that oil and food price shocks significantly affect output, short-term interest rate, inflation rate and real effective exchange rate. However, among all, real effective exchange rate has seen a dominant source of variations in Pakistan. This implies that supply-side and demand-side disturbances originated by external shocks are the major sources of inflation (stagflation) in Pakistan. {\textcopyright} The Pakistan Development Review.},

The quarter frequency data for the period of 1987QII–2017QII is used for the empirical analysis. The key findings suggest that there are substantial differences and asymmetries in the response of these economies to oil shocks. These differences were profound between, and even within, oil exporters and importers. It shows that between major oil exporters i.e. Russia and Brazil the former's economy is rather more intensively influenced by oil prices shocks. Between the two largest net oil importers i.e. India and China, comparatively, the Indian economy seems to be rather more vulnerable to oil prices shocks in terms of their adverse effects on GDP, inflation and balance of trade. The dependence of economies on oil and an increasing level of consumption continue to pose policy challenges for prices and economic stability. The analysis on South Africa also shows negative impacts of oil prices shocks, however, the effects are comparatively more time-variant than other BRICS members. While these asymmetries indicate significant differences in the structure of these economies they also indicate venues of cooperation and stronger trading relationships to overcome the adverse shocks and mutual development.},

Instead of linking oil product pricing only with rise and fall of crude price, this article analyzes the effect of crude price fluctuations by decomposing the crude price changes in quantiles by holding multiple thresholds. Use of multiple threshold nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (MTNARDL) model improves precision in estimating the asymmetric effect of the crude price changes on oil product prices over that of the single threshold NARDL model. It is observed that the asymmetric price transmission is high across all oil products, when higher and lower quantiles of crude price fluctuations are compared. This shows that the price of oil products increases when crude prices go up; however, the advantage of the sharp fall of crude prices is not fully transmitted to the oil products.},

Monthly price data spanning from January 1990 to February 2016 were used for the analysis. The Johansen cointegration test conducted within the time domain confirmed the statistically significant cointegrated relationship between crude oil prices and the price indices of food and its sub-categories, such as dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar; however, frequency information was not accounted for. To incorporate both the time and frequency features of the data, we used a wavelet method that has shown that the world food prices, along with the prices of cereals, vegetable oils, and sugar, co-move with and are led by crude oil prices, results that remain relevant from the short-run policy perspective. The outcome of Toda–Yamamoto causality confirmed the spillover of crude oil price changes to the world food price index also in the long run. The paper ends with the policy implications of these results.},

abstract = {The increasing unemployment in Nigeria has motivated several empirical studies on the causes of the problem in the country. However, attention has not been paid to the contribution of the changes in oil prices to the unemployment problem. As a net exporting oil country, a fluctuation in oil prices in the international market can have impact on economic growth and employment. In the light of this, we investigate the effect of changes in oil prices on unemployment rate in Nigeria, using real oil prices of Brent and West Texas International with linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimation methods. Findings from linear ARDL show that changes in oil prices have little or no significant effects on unemployment rate. The NARDL results indicate that an increase and a decrease in oil prices have an insignificant positive effect on unemployment in the short run. However, in the long run, an increase in oil prices worsens unemployment situation, while a decrease has insignificant reducing effect. We also find evidence of a long-run asymmetric relationship between oil prices and unemployment. The need for government to invest oil revenues in generating more electricity or in providing alternative sources of energy with the objective to reduce the costs of production of firms is recommended.},

The economic growth of developing countries with industrial infrastructure has a more significant association with electricity consumption than oil prices. We use oil prices and electricity consumption jointly to study highly predictive observations for economic growth. The data are categorized by income, OECD and regional levels. The panel cointegration, long-run parameter estimation, and Pool Mean Group tests are used to analyze the cointegration and short-run and long-run relationships between the variables. The empirical results indicate the presence of cointegration between the variables. The presence of feedback effects between electricity consumption and economic growth, oil prices and economic growth is valid. These findings confirm that in spite of the oil prices, developing countries rely heavily on electricity consumption for economic growth. In the short run, growth and feedback effects suggest that more vigorous electricity policies should be implemented to attain sustainable economic growth for the long-term.},

Oil price shocks negatively affect the growth of industrial production and we find that an hundred percent increase in oil prices lowers the growth of industrial production by one percent.

However, the effective operation of monetary policy to this end largely hinges on the nature and dynamics of inflation both in the short-run and long-run. In this context, the present study focuses on theoretical investigation of how crude oil price fluctuations affect inflation in a real economy. Moreover, the study examines the nature of relationship between crude oil price fluctuations and inflation and its impact with reference to Indian economy. The study suggest that, in India, although the price of petroleum products are insulated against international crude oil price fluctuations by way of subsidies in order to curb inflation, in the long run, inflation manifest itself in the form of worsening fiscal deficit and undermine the sustainability of public debt.

In this paper, we address this issue using a structural VAR analysis. Our findings indicate that the responses of agricultural commodity prices to oil price changes depend greatly on whether they are caused oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks or other oil-specific shocks mainly driven by precautionary demand. Oil shocks can explain a minor friction of agricultural commodity price variations before the food crisis in 2006-2008, whereas in post-crisis period their explanatory abilities become much higher. After crisis, the contributions of oil-specific factors to variations in agricultural commodity prices are greater than those of aggregate demand shocks. The results from an alternative SVAR confirm the robustness of our main findings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Instead of analyzing the average causal relationship, as is usually done, we first decompose the data into three cumulative components and investigate the causality between different combinations of extreme positive, extreme negative and normal shocks. These types of combinations can describe all facets of the interactions between crude oil and BRICS stock markets, especially under extreme shocks. In contrast to the results obtained by the traditional Granger causality test, our empirical findings demonstrate that the effect of oil price changes on the stock markets is stronger under extreme circumstances than under normal circumstances. Furthermore, large upward or downward oil price changes have an asymmetric impact on extreme upward or downward stock price changes. Finally, robustness checks verify the rationality and validity of the extreme Granger causality analysis.},

The key findings suggest that there are substantial differences and asymmetries in the response of these economies to oil shocks. These differences were profound between, and even within, oil exporters and importers. It shows that between major oil exporters i.e. Russia and Brazil the former's economy is rather more intensively influenced by oil prices shocks. Between the two largest net oil importers i.e. India and China, comparatively, the Indian economy seems to be rather more vulnerable to oil prices shocks in terms of their adverse effects on GDP, inflation and balance of trade. The dependence of economies on oil and an increasing level of consumption continue to pose policy challenges for prices and economic stability. The analysis on South Africa also shows negative impacts of oil prices shocks, however, the effects are comparatively more time-variant than other BRICS members. While these asymmetries indicate significant differences in the structure of these economies they also indicate venues of cooperation and stronger trading relationships to overcome the adverse shocks and mutual development.},

Three major channels of transmission viz. import channel, price channel, and fiscal channel are explored with the help of a structural macroeconomic framework. The policy option of deregulation of domestic oil prices in the scenario of occurrence of a one-time shock in international oil prices as well as no oil price shock situation analysed through its impact on growth, inflation, fiscal balances and external balances during the 12th Plan period of 2012-13 to 2016-17. The simulation results indicate that in the short run the deregulation policy would have adverse impact on the growth as well as on the inflation. But if this policy is complemented with the policy of switching of subsidy bill to capital expenditure it might result in positive growth effects in the medium and long run. Given, the current passthrough policy, one-time oil shock has adverse impact on growth and inflation in the year of shock while it mitigates slowly over time. The model shows that with the oil shock and with current partial pass-through regime, a 10 percent rise in oil prices result in a 0.6 percent fall in growth while in the full pass-through situation, it can reduce the growth by 0.9 percent. Overall, the paper argues that the pass-through has differential impact on growth and inflation over the 12th Plan period. Hence, the policy of oil price deregulation must be carefully weighed and prioritised.},

The empirical analysis is conducted using four wavelet tools: wavelet coherency, phase-difference, multiple correlation and multiple cross-correlation. The first two tools are used to identify the timefrequency co-movement of and lead\textendash lag relationship between price indices of oil and 21 agricultural commodities, and the third and fourth tool are used to identify the leader and follower among all series of price indices across different scales. Our results on wavelet coherency show a high degree of co-movement at a long-run horizon for the entire period between the price indices of oil and coal, cotton, fishmeal, maize, rice, rubber and wheat. Furthermore, the connection between these commodity markets and the oil market strengthened after 2000, indicating the importance of financial crisis phenomena and geopolitical turbulence. Additional findings show that short-run investors should invest in the beef and swine (pork) markets, as they have very little correlation with the oil markets. The results of multiple correlation and multiple cross-correlation analysis show that the coffee price was leader or follower across all time scales, except wavelet scale 16, where barely was a leader or a follower.},

In this article, we analyze the changes in food trade balances associated with the 32\% increase in food prices from 2000/2001 to 2004/2005. We find a small deterioration in food trade balances of low-income countries and an improvement in middle-income countries. The deterioration is most severe for countries in conflict and small island states, so attention should be placed first on these countries and on a few very-low-income countries that are also vulnerable. Because low-income countries as a group had much lower agricultural GDP growth rates than middle-income countries, the answers to food vulnerability in low-income countries should probably be addressed within the context of incentives for agricultural production.},

According to the results of impulse response functions, agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. Our results show that there is a linkage between energy and food security through price volatility. Since inflation in oil price is harmful for food security, it would be necessary to diversify the energy consumption in this sector, from too much reliance on fossil fuels to an optimal combination of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources that will be in favor of not only the energy security by also the food security. In addition, the paper found that the impact of biofuel prices on food prices is statistically significant but explains less than 2\% of the food price variance. However, by increasing the demand for biofuel, there should be more concern about the global increase in agricultural commodities prices and endangering food security, especially in vulnerable economies.},

  abstract={This paper examines the effect of crude oil prices on the prices of 35 internationally traded primary commodities for the 1960-2005 period. It finds that the pass-through of crude oil price changes to the overall non-energy commodity index is 0.16. At a more disaggregated level, the fertilizer index had the highest pass-through (0.33), followed by agriculture (0.17), and metals (0.11). The prices of precious metals also exhibited a strong response to the crude oil price. In terms of individual commodities, the estimates of the food group exhibited remarkable similarity while those of raw materials and metals gave a mixed picture. The implication is that if crude oil prices remain high for some time, as most analysts expect, then the recent commodity price boom is likely to last much longer than earlier booms, at least for food commodities. The other commodities, however, are likely to follow diverging paths. On the methodological side, the results show that price indices, while providing useful summary statistics, need to be supplemented by individual commodity analysis.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

The macroeconomic variables studied were crude oil prices, consumer price indexes, food production indexes and GDP around the world between 1961 and 2005. We use the Scree test and the proportion of variance method for determining the optimal number of common factors. The correlation coefficient between the extracted principal component and the macroeconomic index varies between 0.87 for the world GDP and 0.36 for the consumer price index. We find the food production index has the greatest influence on the macroeconomic index and that the oil price index has an influence on the food production index. Consequently, crude oil prices have an indirect effect on food prices.},

We use a structural VAR (SVAR) model based on monthly data over the period 1986−2009. The EGARCH model estimates show an important asymmetric effect of oil price shocks on the conditional oil price volatility. Dynamic impulse response functions obtained from the SVAR model show a prolonged dampening effect of oil price volatility shock on Malaysian industrial production. We also find that levels of Consumer Price Index (CPI) decline with a positive shock to oil price uncertainty. This is the result of negative demand shock due to the postponement of consumption of big ticket items by individuals, households and other sectors of the economy. We also found that the Malaysian central bank adopts an expansionary monetary policy in response to oil price uncertainty. Variance decomposition analysis reconfirms that volatility in the oil price is the second most important factor to explain the variance of industrial production after its own shocks. These results shed some light on how the central bank of Malaysia can use controlling mechanisms to stabilize aggregate output and price level.}

Moreover, under shocks of oil price jumps, not only the returns but also the risks of China's bulk commodity markets are affected significantly, and the reactions of risks are characterized by “overreactions”. Meanwhile, by decomposing oil price shocks into expected positive (negative), and unexpected positive (negative) components, we discovered that the impacts of unexpected shocks are positive and significantly asymmetric at both levels, while those of the expected shocks are negative and insignificantly asymmetric at the industry level. In addition, the volatility clustering of all price movements and the permanent volatility effects on China's bulk commodities are also authenticated by applying the GARCH family models.}

  abstract={SummaryUS retail food price increases in recent years may seem large in nominal terms, but after adjusting for inflation have been quite modest even after the change in US biofuel policies in 2006. In contrast, increases in the real prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and rice received by US farmers have been more substantial and can be linked in part to increases in the real price of oil. That link, however, appears largely driven by common macroeconomic determinants of the prices of oil and of agricultural commodities rather than the pass-through from higher oil prices. We show that there is no evidence that corn ethanol mandates have created a tight link between oil and agricultural markets. Moreover, increases in agricultural commodity prices have contributed little to US retail food price increases, because of the small cost share of agricultural products in food prices. In short, there is no evidence that oil price shocks have been associated with more than a negligible increase in US retail food prices in recent years. Nor is there evidence for the prevailing wisdom that oil-price driven increases in the cost of food processing, packaging, transportation and distribution have been responsible for higher retail food prices. Similar results hold for other industrialized countries. There is reason, however, to expect food commodity prices to be more tightly linked to retail food prices in developing countries.— Christiane Baumeister and Lutz Kilian},

abstract = {This study focuses on the effects of oil price changes on food prices in oil-exporting developing countries between 2001 and 2014. These effects in net food-importing and oil-exporting, developing countries have not received adequate attention in literature. The methodology included the application of a non-linear panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The bound testing cointegration analysis of the non-linear panel ARDL specification suggests the presence of co-integration among the variables: food prices, oil price, inflation, and trade openness. The estimated non-linear panel ARDL model indicated the presence of asymmetry in the behavior of food prices solely in the long run. More specifically, in the long run, there is a significant and positive relationship between oil price increases and food prices. Meanwhile, no long-run relation is found between oil price reduction and food prices. Furthermore, the model suggests the absence of asymmetry in the behavior of food prices in the short run, as the relations between both increase and reduction in oil price and food prices are found to be insignificant. The study, therefore, recommends that oil-exporting developing countries should adjust their public policy schemes in such a way as to enable reductions in the oil price to trickle down to food prices. In addition, these countries should ensure the implementation of long-term agricultural policies aimed at insulating their economies from global food crises that may arise due to oil price increases.},

The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags (NARDL) models were used to capture the asymmetric pass-through effects of oil price increases and decreases in consumer price and producer price respectively. Our results revealed that oil price changes can have asymmetric effect on consumer price index (CPI) inflation directly and indirectly with more influential impact of indirect effect. This result holds for both groups of countries. The effect on producer price is much larger especially in oil-importing group due to the high dependence of these countries on oil. Oil price changes did lead to increases in consumer prices in oil-importing countries. This may due to effective monetary policy that enhances price stickiness in the economy.},

abstract = {Empirical studies show that asymmetric the effects of oil shocks on macroeconomic variables can review in oil-exporting countries like oil-importing countries. In this regard, this paper tries to investigate the asymmetric effects of oil shocks on inflation in OPEC member countries (including Iran) using hidden panel co-integration approach during the period 1990-2014. To achieve the purpose, first, the variables of crude oil prices and consumer price index for these countries are decomposed to cumulative positive and negative components. then, according to the cross-sectional dependence in the models, used the Pesaran unit root test (2007) and Westerlund co-integration test (2007) and shown that does not exist long-run relationship between crude oil prices and the consumer price index (not support linear co-integration); but there is a long-term relationship between positive components this variables and between positive components of consumer price index and negative components of oil prices (support hidden co-integration). Finally, these long-term relationships estimated by using the continuously-updated and fully-modified (Cup-FM). The results show that both positive and negative oil price shock increase the inflation in the OPEC member countries, so that the impact of negative shocks is more than positive shocks (support asymmetry).},

Asymmetries are introduced by accumulating oil price increases separately from decreases using partial sum processes in a nonlinear ARDL framework. Utilizing annual data for the period 1973–2018, the results from the linear ARDL model suggest that oil price changes do not affect the domestic output of Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. However, the nonlinear ARDL model reveals that oil price changes asymmetrically affect the domestic output of all seven Asian countries in both the short-run and in the long-run. We observe an asymmetrically larger effect on output from rising oil prices than from falling prices, but effects vary across countries. Moreover, nonlinear causality tests confirm causality from oil price to output in all the countries.},

We then analyze the time-varying effects of these oil price shocks on China's inflation at the import, production and consumption stages using monthly data from January 1999 to December 2016. The results show that the pass-through effects of the four types of oil price shocks on China's inflation at each stage are time-varying and that there are significant differences at different time horizons and points in time. The analysis of the variance decomposition shows that the effects of oil price shocks on China's inflation at each stage are incomplete and decrease along the price chain. The increase in oil prices driven by oil-specific demand shocks is the most important cause of China's inflation at the import and production stages during the full sample period, while China's inflation at the consumption stage is mainly affected by domestic demand shocks. In addition, the inflationary effects of oil price shocks have been dramatically weaker since the international financial crisis compared with before the crisis.},

The bounds test of the NARDL specification suggests the presence of cointegration among the variables, which include the food price, oil price and real GDP. The estimated NARDL model affirms the presence of asymmetries in the food price behavior. Namely, in the long run, we find a significant relation between oil price increases and food price. Meanwhile, the long run relation between oil price reduction and the food price is absent. Furthermore, in the short run, only changes in the positive oil price exert significant influences on the food price inflation. With the absence of significant influence of oil price reduction on the food price both in the long run and in the short run, the role of market power in shaping the behavior of Malaysia's food price is likely to be significant.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether the underlying regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard F- and t-statistics used to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibrium correction mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null hypothesis that there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I(0) or I(1). Two sets of asymptotic critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I(1) and the other if they are all purely I(0). These two sets of critical values provide a band covering all possible classifications of the regressors into purely I(0), purely I(1) or mutually cointegrated. Accordingly, various bounds testing procedures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed tests are consistent, and their asymptotic distribution under the null and suitably defined local alternatives are derived. The empirical relevance of the bounds procedures is demonstrated by a re-examination of the earnings equation included in the UK Treasury macroeconometric model.

With Indonesia observing an inflation targeting policy, this study applies the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) technique to investigate the effect of oil price fluctuations in Indonesia. The relationship is important for the central bank to gauge the effectiveness of the inflation targeting policy in immunizing the country from oil price fluctuations. Our findings have revealed that there was an asymmetric behavior between oil price and the inflation rate (producer price index), thus questioning the effectiveness of the inflation targeting policy. More specifically, in the long run, an increase in the oil price will tend to lead to an increase in the rate of inflation with a greater deviation, while an oil price reduction will lead to a decrease in the inflation rate with a lower deviation. This suggests that the benefits of an oil price reduction are not passed down to the consumer.},

Using panel-Auto Regressive Distributive Lag (panel-ARDL), we examined the impact of oil price on economic growth in the short and long run. The results show that oil price does not have a significant impact on economic growth in the short run for the group, but has a negative significant impact in the long run. However, the short-run country coefficients show that oil price has a significant but mixed effect on economic growth in all the seven countries. Using the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model, we also examined the asymmetric effect of oil price on economic growth by decomposing oil price into negative and positive changes. The advantage of this model is that it examines both the long-run and short-run asymmetric effects of real oil price on growth. We found that a decrease in oil price has a positive and significant impact on growth, while oil price increase has a significant negative effect. Moreover, the error correction terms are negative and statistically significant for both the PMG and five of the countries in the short-run country coefficients. Therefore, it would be important for policymakers to explore and implement efficient energy policies and employ technological advancement policies to mitigate oil price risks, especially in the long run.}

abstract = {Purpose: High inflation levels remain a challenge in macroeconomic stabilization policies among developing economies. Oil price is identified as an important driver of inflation. In the wake of high and unstable international oil prices, the question regarding the relationship between inflation and crude oil prices, and its implication for economic welfare has become a fundamental empirical issue. Design/methodology/approach: This question is explored by estimating a non-linear autoregressive distribution lags (NARDL) model of inflation-oil nexus that examined the asymmetric response of inflation to oil price changes. The study then derived the welfare implication of the asymmetric responses, with implications for the petroleum pricing regime in Ghana. Findings: The study found that inflation responds asymmetrically to oil prices in the long-run but not in the short-run. The welfare cost associated with the asymmetric response increases with increasing rate. Practical implications: The findings of this study have some implications for petroleum product pricing in Ghana. Recently, Ghana has moved from regulating petroleum prices to the automatic adjustment system. By this policy, petroleum prices change in tandem with the crude oil prices and exchange rates on the international market. Whiles this policy might be comparatively efficient, the evidence of asymmetric response of inflation to changes in oil prices raises some issues about the welfare effect of the policy. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on the inflation-oil price nexus by investigating critical questions that remain puzzling. These questions include; Does inflation respond asymmetrically to the positive and negative shock of equal magnitude in oil prices? Does inflation response to the asymmetry changes in oil prices have any implications for the welfare of the country? Is the effect of oil price changes pernicious?},

The study reveals that the economic activities of resource-poor countries that specialise in heavy manufacturing industries, like Korea and Taiwan, are highly affected by world oil price shocks. On the other hand, the economic activities of oil-poor nations such as Australia and New Zealand, with diverse mineral resources other than oil, are not affected by oil price shocks. Furthermore, countries that are oil poor but specialise in international financial services, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, are also not affected by oil price increases. Moreover, some developing countries, in this case, India, with limited reserves of oil are not affected by oil price shocks, whereas other such countries, like Thailand, possessing a number of natural resources other than oil are more strongly affected by oil price shocks. With regard to food price shocks, limited impacts from food price increases can be recorded for India, Korea and Thailand. Overall, the effects of external oil and food prices depend on the economic characteristics of the countries.},

The results showed that the crude oil price has a positive impact on the rate of inflation whereas an inverse relation exists between crude oil price and economic growth. Further, we segregated the crude oil price into two components, that is, positive and negative partial sum of oil price through the nonlinear and asymmetric autoregressive distribution lag framework. A similar kind of result is derived in the case of positive partial sum of oil price on the rate of inflation and economic growth, while a significant negative relationship is found in the negative partial sum of crude oil price on economic growth. From the policy perceptive, we suggest that policymakers may focus on reducing the consumption of crude oil and using renewable energy for accelerating the economic growth. This would not only prevent the domestic economy from international oil price fluctuations and inflation but also assist in achieving sustainable environmental goal of reduced crude oil use.JEL Classification Codes: C3, O4, Q4 }
